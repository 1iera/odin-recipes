    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 potatoes</li>
        <li>4 carrots
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>minced garlic</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large soup pot, combine the hominy, potatoes, carrots, 1 cup onions, garlic, oregano, and cumin with 1 cup water; cook on medium heat for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add 8 cups of water, diced chiles, and guajillo and ancho chile powders. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer and cook for 30 to 40 minutes until the hominy has softened and the stew has thickened. Add salt to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the tortilla strips on the baking sheet and bake until crispy and golden-brown, 20 to 25 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally for even browning. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>To serve, ladle the stew into individual bowls and garnish with tortilla strips, cabbage, radishes, remaining onions, and cilantro. Serve a wedge of lime on the side.
